MIGHTY DUNGEON GOLD GITTER 

---------------------------------

OVERVIEW

The Mighty Dungeon Gold Gitter application is a text-based Role Playing Game (RPG) where players venture into the dark dungeon to collect as much gold as possible. Each room in the dungeon contains gold which can be collected by completing challenges or defeating enemies. Engaging narratives help keep players focused and enthralled in the mission to win the game. 

The game has a one-person playing mode with one player playing solo or competing against another to collect gold, one at a time. The player that is not in play mode has a limited view of their opponents’ progress. Players can be killed or maimed in each dungeon room but have three lives to collect gold. The game ends when a solo player or both players have died or when a solo player has completed the Gold Gitter’s Ultimate Challenge. The player who collects the most gold wins the game.
